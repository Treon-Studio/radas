# Frontend Commands

Radas CLI provides a set of specialized tools to help frontend developers efficiently manage their UI projects.

## Frontend (FE) Commands

### Project Initialization

Create a new frontend project structure with standardized configuration:

```bash
# Initialize frontend project structure
radas fe init
```

This command will:
- Create the recommended directory structure
- Initialize package.json with necessary dependencies
- Set up linting and testing configuration
- Create a basic README.md

### Building Applications

Compile frontend code for deployment:

```bash
# Build frontend application
radas fe build
```

Additional options:
```bash
# Build for a specific environment
radas fe build --env=production

# Build with additional optimizations
radas fe build --optimize
```

### Running Tests

Execute the test suite for your frontend application:

```bash
# Run all frontend tests
radas fe test

# Run specific tests
radas fe test --spec=component-name

# Run tests in watch mode
radas fe test --watch
```

### Code Linting

Verify code quality and style consistency:

```bash
# Lint frontend codebase
radas fe lint

# Lint with auto-fix
radas fe lint --fix
```

## Best Practices

### Project Structure

Use the following standard project structure for frontend projects:

```
src/
├── assets/       # Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
├── components/   # Reusable UI components
├── pages/        # Page-level components
├── services/     # API communication logic
├── styles/       # Global styling files
└── utils/        # Helper functions and utilities
```

### Development Workflow

1. Start with `radas fe init` for new projects
2. Use `radas fe lint` regularly during development
3. Run `radas fe test` before pushing changes
4. Use `radas fe build` to prepare for deployment

## Integration with Other Frontend Tools

Radas CLI integrates well with popular frontend tools:

- **React**: Supports create-react-app and Next.js
- **Vue**: Supports Vue CLI and Nuxt.js
- **Angular**: Supports Angular CLI
