# Installing Radas CLI

Radas CLI is designed to be simple to install and update. The tool supports multiple operating systems and architectures with a streamlined installation process.

## Quick Installation

You can install Radas CLI with a single command using the official installation script. This script automatically detects your operating system and architecture, downloads the appropriate binary, and places it in your system path.

### Using curl

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Treon-Studio/radas/main/apps/radas-cli/install.sh | bash
```

### Using wget

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Treon-Studio/radas/main/apps/radas-cli/install.sh | bash
```

The installation script will:
1. Detect your operating system and architecture
2. Download the appropriate `.tar.gz` release asset from GitHub
3. Extract the binary
4. Place it in `/usr/local/bin` (requiring sudo permissions if needed)
5. Make the binary executable

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that Radas CLI was installed correctly by running:

```bash
radas version
```

This should display the current version of Radas CLI installed on your system.

## Installation Options

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to manually install Radas CLI, you can:

1. Visit the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Treon-Studio/radas/releases)
2. Download the appropriate binary for your system 
   (e.g., `radas_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` for Apple Silicon Mac)
3. Extract the archive: `tar -xzf radas_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`
4. Move the binary to your PATH: `sudo mv radas /usr/local/bin/`
5. Make it executable: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/radas`

### Installation Location

By default, Radas CLI is installed to `/usr/local/bin/radas` which makes it available system-wide. If you don't have permissions for this directory or prefer to install it elsewhere, you can modify the installation script or extract the binary manually to your preferred location.

Just ensure the installation directory is in your system PATH.

## System Requirements

Radas CLI is supported on:

- **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **Linux** (amd64 and arm64)
- **Windows** (amd64)

The CLI is a standalone binary with no external dependencies required.

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission issues during installation:

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Treon-Studio/radas/main/apps/radas-cli/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Binary Not Found After Installation

If the `radas` command is not found after installation, verify:
1. The binary was installed to a directory in your PATH
2. You've restarted your terminal session since installation
3. The binary has executable permissions: `chmod +x /path/to/radas`

### Manual Download

If the automatic installer doesn't work, you can download the binary directly from the GitHub releases page and place it in your PATH manually.
