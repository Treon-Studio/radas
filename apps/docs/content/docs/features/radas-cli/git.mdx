# Git Commands

Radas CLI enhances Git workflows with simplified commands for common version control operations, making repository management more efficient and consistent across teams.

## Branch Management

### Creating Branches

Create and switch to new branches:

```bash
# Create a new branch
radas create-branch <branch-name>

# Create branch with specific base
radas create-branch <branch-name> --base=main

# Create branch with ticket reference
radas create-branch <branch-name> --ticket=PROJ-123
```

### Managing Branches

List and delete branches:

```bash
# List all branches
radas list-branch

# List remote branches
radas list-branch --remote

# Delete a branch locally and remotely
radas del-branch <branch-name>
```

## Commit Operations

### Creating Commits

Create well-formatted commits:

```bash
# Commit changes with a message
radas commit "Add new feature"

# Commit with ticket reference
radas commit "Add new feature" --ticket=PROJ-123

# Create commit with specific scope
radas commit "Fix bug" --scope=auth
```

### Push Operations

Push changes to remote repositories:

```bash
# Push changes to current branch
radas push

# Quick commit and push in one command
radas just-push "Update documentation"

# Push to specific remote
radas push --remote=upstream
```

## Repository Operations

### Cloning Repositories

Clone repositories with additional setup:

```bash
# Clone a repository
radas clone <repository-url>

# Clone and set up development environment
radas clone <repository-url> --setup

# Clone with specific branch
radas clone <repository-url> --branch=develop
```

### Fetching Changes

Pull and update repositories:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
radas pull

# Pull from specific remote/branch
radas pull --remote=origin --branch=main

# Pull with automatic stash/unstash
radas pull --autostash
```

### Repository Navigation

Quick navigation between repositories:

```bash
# Navigate to a repository
radas goto <repo-name>

# List available repository shortcuts
radas goto --list
```

## Git Workflow Patterns

Radas CLI supports various Git workflow patterns:

### Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# Start a new feature
radas create-branch feature/new-feature
# ... make changes ...
radas commit "Implement new feature"
radas push
```

### Conventional Commits

Enforce consistent commit messages:

```bash
# Conventional commit formats
radas commit "feat: add new button component"
radas commit "fix: resolve login issue"
radas commit "docs: update installation guide"
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Hygiene

1. Use descriptive commit messages with `radas commit`
2. Link commits to tickets using the `--ticket` flag
3. Follow conventional commits format when applicable
4. Keep commits focused on single concerns

### Branch Management

1. Use consistent branch naming with `radas create-branch`
2. Clean up branches after merging with `radas del-branch`
3. Periodically sync with the main branch
4. Use feature branches for isolated development

## Integration with Git Platforms

Radas CLI integrates with popular Git hosting platforms:

- **GitHub**: Pull requests, issues, and actions
- **GitLab**: Merge requests and CI/CD integration
- **Bitbucket**: Pull requests and pipeline integration
- **Azure DevOps**: Work items and build pipelines
